## Install

#### Find your resourcepacks folder

The quickest and easiest way to do this is from in-game.

1. Open up your desired version of Minecraft.
2. Go into "Options" and then "Resource Packs"
3. Click "Open Pack Folder"

#### Download the pack

The easiest way to do this is to clone the repo, if you have Git installed. Open a terminal or commandline in your resourcepacks folder and clone:

    git clone https://github.com/Xetheon/mc-geometric-font "Geometric Font"

This will also keep the pack up do date automatically. Alternatively, you can download the pack manually by going to any of its release pages.
